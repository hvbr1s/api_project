## API Request to the /api Route  

To make an API request to the /api route, you need to use the HTTP GET method and include the FIREBASE_API_KEY as a query parameter. The request should also include user_input and user_id as query parameters.

Here is an example of how to format the request:  

`GET http://localhost:8888/api?api_key=<FIREBASE_API_KEY>&user_input=<USER_INPUT>&user_id=<USER_ID>`

Replace `<FIREBASE_API_KEY>`, `<USER_INPUT>`, and `<USER_ID>` with your actual Firebase API key, user input, and user ID respectively.

### Parameters  

- api_key (required): This is the Firebase API key that you have acquired. It is used for authentication.
- user_input (required): This is the input from the user that you want to process.
- user_id (required): This is the ID of the user making the request.
Response

If the request is successful, the server will forward the response from the target address. If the api_key is invalid or not provided, the server will respond with a 403 status code. If there is an error during forwarding the request, the server will respond with the status code of the error response or 500 if the error response is not available.
